## Project Overview and Objectives

**Sleepywears.ph** is an online clothing store that previously relied on manual processes such as handwritten invoices and paper-based order tracking. These methods were time-consuming, error-prone, and made it difficult to monitor sales and inventory accurately.

This **Business Management System** was developed to:

* Reduce manual workload and minimize human errors in transaction recording
* Replace paper-based processes with an automated, web-based system
* Improve efficiency in managing orders, generating invoices, and tracking inventory
* Provide clear insights into **gross and net income** for better decision-making
* Store and organize customer information for easier repeat transactions
* Support the digital transformation of Sleepywears.ph
* Ensure the system is user-friendly and accessible, even for users with limited technical skills

This system improves **accuracy, efficiency, organization, and overall business operations**.
